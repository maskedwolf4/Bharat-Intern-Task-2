## Iris Flower Classification ML Model

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project was developed as Task 2 for the Bharat Intern Virtual Internship.

### Project Overview

This project aims to build an ML model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their three known species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements using TensorFlow.
This involved:

* **Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the Iris dataset, analyzing its distribution, and visualizing relationships between features.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transforming the sepal and petal measurements into suitable inputs for the deep learning model.
* **Deep Learning Model Development:** Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow to differentiate between the three Iris species.
* **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, cross-entropy.

### What I Learned

Working on this project significantly enhanced my understanding of:

* **EDA:** I honed my ability to explore and analyze datasets using various techniques, gain insights into their characteristics, and prepare them for modeling.
* **Feature Engineering:** I learned different approaches to transform raw data into features suitable for deep learning models, improving their ability to learn complex relationships.
* **Deep Learning with TensorFlow:** I gained practical experience in building and training NN using TensorFlow, understanding their architecture and hyperparameter tuning strategies.
* **Machine Learning Evaluation:** I developed skills in evaluating model performance using various metrics, identifying areas for improvement, and refining the model accordingly.

### Requirements

This project requires the following libraries:

* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
